#+title: RISC-V Virtualized

* libvirt (as of 2025)

Use the image from [[https://people.debian.org/~gio/dqib/][Debian Quick Image Baker]], a zip file consists a root
filesystem, a kernel, an initrd, several ssh keys. Set kernel path to uboot.elf
and boot off the root image.

The default unprivileged login name
and password is =debian= and the =root= user's password is =root=. OpenSBI does
not seem to be necessary or maybe the default. There is already OpenSSH started
and configured. The network should be configured as static due to lack of a DHCP client.
