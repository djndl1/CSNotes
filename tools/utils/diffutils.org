** =cmp=: Whether Two Files Differ By Bytes

The result is the returned status and possibly the first different line.

- =-l=, =--verbose= :: output each differing byte.

** =comm= (not from =diffutils=, but from =coreutils=): Compare Two Sorted Files By Lines

** =diff=

Difference is defined as a series of lines deleted from, inserted into or
changed in one file to produce the the file. =diff= reports file difference in
this way. Certain difference may be ignored by =diff= with certain options.
=diff= also supports various kinds of interpretation of difference. =diff= tries
to minimize the total hunk size by finding large sequences of common lines
interspersed with small hunks of differing lines, that is, difference is not
determined simply by comparing corresponding lines.

- /hunks/ :: groups of differing lines

=diff= may also be applied to directories, creating a single patch file for
multiple files.

*** Ignore Changes

**** Regex Pattern

- =-I REGEXP= :: insertions and deletions of matching lines are ignored
  + multiple =-I= options may be used.

**** Case

- =-i= :: ignore case changes

**** Whitespaces

How blank characters are

- =-E= :: ignore tab/space difference

- =-Z= :: ignore trailing space

- =-b= :: the difference in the number of white spaces is ignored; trailing
  white spaces are ignored

- =-w= :: even stronger. It ignores the difference between zero whitespace and one whitespace

**** Blank Lines

- =-B= :: changes consisting of blank lines are ignored. A blank line
  is =^$=, without any blank characters.

*** Text or Binary

=diff= compares text files line by line, and for binary files outputs a
brief report. =diff= heuristically checks if a file is binary by checking the
first few magic number of the file, or if any byte in that file is zero.

- =-a= :: force text mode

On systems such as MS Windows, where text files and binary files are
distinguished, =diff= normally reads and writes as text unless =--binary= is
forced. On such systems, =CRLF= is properly processed (read and write) in text
mode, but in binary mode, =CR= is processed as is.

- =--strip-trailing-cr= :: =CRLF= is interpreted as =LF= while reading.

*** Output

**** Report

- =-q= :: brief report without differing lines
  + most widely supported
  +  especially useful when comparing the contents of two directories.
  + this output format is also used when one of the compared files is binary.


#+begin_src
< # first (left, original) file
> # second (right, updated) file
--- # separated by
c # change
a # append
d # delete, typically the line number after d may be ignored, which is the position a difference is found
#+end_src

- =-u= :: unified view, typically used by Git

- =-c= :: copied context format
+ context lines and file names saves us from some typing when applying
  patches

** patch

#+begin_src shell
# patch a single file
patch file patch_file.patch
patch original -i patch_file.patch -o updated
patch -i patch_file.patch -o updated # patch file with file names

# patch a directory

patch -pN -i patch_file.patch 
# the N number depends on the CWD relative to the original directory

# reverse a patch
patch -pN -R -i patch_file.patch

# with git
git apply [--check] patch_file.patch
