* Difference from Vim

** Architecture

Neovim uses runtime *providers* to implement some features whose behavior may
depend on the system and environment, unlike Vim 8, where these features may
be enabled at compile time.

e.g. to enable python support
#+begin_src shell
python -m pip install neovim
#+end_src
