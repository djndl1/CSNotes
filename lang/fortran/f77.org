#+title: Fortran 77

* Basics

** Tools

gfortran has legacy support (~-std=legacy~) for f77 and non-standard extensions.
The default =gnu= mode is similar but with warning for obsolete extensions.

Valid f77 programs are valid f95 programs.
Most standard-conforming f77 code can be compiled with gfortran without issues 
due to the backward compatibility of the language

#+begin_quote
Compiler capability is quite extensive and includes nearly all g77 features. 
Legacy g77 code will compile fine in almost all cases.

** Program Organization

A main program (driver) and possibly subprograms (procedures or subroutines).

#+begin_src fortran
    program name

    declarations

    statements

    stop
    end
#+end_src

** Fixed Format

f77 is not a free-format language: it has a strict set of rules for how source code should be formatted.

- column 1: blank, =c= or =*= for comments

- column 1-5 for statement label

- column 6 continuation of previous line. Long statements from the last line may continue at the column.

- column 7-72: statements

- column 73-80: sequence number

f90 and later versions permit free format, there is no need to adhere to fixed format.

For gfortran

#+begin_quote
Source files with .f, .for, .fpp, .ftn, .F, .FOR, .FPP, and .FTN extensions are treated as fixed form.
Source files with .f90, .f95, .f03, .f08, .F90, .F95, .F03 and .F08 extensions are treated as free form.
The capitalized versions of either form are run through preprocessing.
Source files with the lower case .fpp extension are also run through preprocessing. 
#+end_quote

** Types & Declaratios

The widths of primitive data types are configurable in modern fortran
with =KIND= type parameter and =SELECTED_INT_KIND=, =SELETED_REAL_KIND=
to ensure portability. Primitive types can have many "kinds" 
(of different sizes, ranges and even semantics).

The widths are not specified by the standard.
In gfortran, by default =integer= is 4-byte, =real= 4-byte, =double precision= 8 byte, character 1-byte.

#+begin_src fortran
    type var1, var2, var3
c define some constants
    parameter (pi = 3.14159)
#+end_src

- Common blocks are shared global static storage in F77, accessible from various compilation units. 
  Each time it is used by a subprogram, it has to be declared inside the subprogram using the same declaration 
  (possibly with different variable names).

*** Array

All arrays' sizes are determined at compile-time and arrays may reside on the stack 
or in static storage. In gfortran, a local variable larger than =-fmax-stack-var-size=
will be moved out of the stack. Otherwise, gfortran treats variable storage in a similar to how C does.

- by default,  1-based. Like BASIC, the range may be explicitly specified.

- =real A(3, 5)= is a matrix

- the memory storage format is different from that of a C matrix: 2-dimensional arrays are stored by /column/!
  $addr[A(i,j)] = addr[A(1,1)] + (j-1)*lda + (i-1)$
  + to treat a column as a vector, use =A(1, j)= since column elements are adjacent.
  + to scale a matrix, we simply treat it as a vector of length $m \times n$ 
  and scale it using a vector routine as long as the matrix' declared dimension matches
  that of the underlying real matrix.

- up to 7 dimensions

- variable-length arrays are declared as =real A(*)=: however, they know nothing about their length in F77.

- (obsolete) =dimension array_variable(size)=, compare this to BASIC =redim=.

#+begin_src fortran
      subroutine saxpy (n, alpha, x, y)
      integer n
      real alpha, x(*), y(*)
c
c Saxpy: Compute y := alpha*x + y,
c where x and y are vectors of length n (at least).
c
c Local variables
      integer i
c
      do 10 i = 1, n
         y(i) = alpha*x(i) + y(i)
   10 continue
c
      return
      end

      subroutine matvec (m, n, A, lda, x, y)
      integer m, n, lda
      real x(*), y(*), A(lda,*)
c
c Compute y = A*x, where A is m by n and stored in an array
c with leading dimension lda.
c
c Local variables
      integer i, j
      
c Initialize y
      do 10 i = 1, m
         y(i) = 0.0
   10 continue

c Matrix-vector product by saxpy on columns in A.
c Notice that the length of each column of A is m, not n!
c We use A(1,j), a pointer to the first element of each column
c this fortran matrix * vector is not how linear algebra typical handles multiplication
      do 20 j = 1, n
         call saxpy (m, x(j), A(1,j), y)
   20 continue

      return
      end
#+end_src

** Control Flow

- =elseif=. =endif= is used to end an =if= block.
  + gfortran supports =else if=

- there is the one and only standard loop construct =do= loop, similar to a range-for.
  + the label has to be a number.
  + the three expressions are only evaluated once, right before the loop body runs.

  #+begin_src fortran
          do label var = start_expr, end_expression[, step_expression]
            statements
   label  continue
  #+end_src

- ~/=~ for =.ne.= in modern fortran. Modern symbol-like relational operators are not supported by f77.
  + ~==~ (=.ne.=) and ~/=~ (=.eq.=) are undefined for logical types.
    =.eqv.= and =.neqv.= should be used for logical comparison.
    g77 manual argues for this for reason of more explicit precedence order.

- =enddo= in place of =label continue=, =while () do enddo=, =do while () enddo=, =do until ()= exist 
  as extensions.
  + the standard way is to use =if= with =goto=.
  + gfortran supports =do while=, =enddo= and =end do=, but not  =do until=, =while do=.
  + modern fortran has =exit= (breaking out of the loop) and =cycle= (continue the next iteration).
    Tags (text labels) are used to label a loop to allow easier =exit= or =cycle= without resorting a 
    flag variable.

  #+begin_src fortran
c a while loop
 10    if (condition) 
          loop body

          goto 10
       endif
  #+end_src

** Subprograms (Functions & Subroutines)

- F77 syntax: the function name serves as the return variable, similar to BASIC.
  The function has be to declared where it is used. It has a type, its return type.

  #+begin_src Fortran
  real function r(m, t)
  integer m
  real t

  r = 0.1 * t + (m ** 2 + 14 * m + 46)
  if (r .LT. 0) r = 0.0

  return 
  end
  #+end_src
  A =subroutine= returns nothing but its parameters may be used to return multiple values.
  
- F77 uses call by reference (similar to BASIC). There is a reason why modern Fortran encourages
  parameter intent (in, out, inout): to avoid unexpected assignment of outer variables.
  #+begin_src fortran
      subroutine iswap (a, b)
      integer a, b
c Local variables
      integer tmp

      tmp = a
      a = b
      b = tmp

      return
      end
  #+end_src 

- In modern Fortran, return value can be specified by naming the variable.
  parameters are declared like in old-style C, below the subprogram declaration,
  with type and =intent(in/out/inout)=.

- Builtin subprograms may be type-generic even though F77 itself is not.

- F77 does not support recursion: many compilers did support it.
