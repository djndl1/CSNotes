* Built-in =logging=

** Architecture

Each module creates its own =logging.Logger= with the module name as the logger's name.
=logging.Logger= is what the application code uses to output logs.

A logger dispatches log records to *handlers* (targets) 
and handlers send the log records to appropriate destinations.

Formatters are responsible to format log records into the final output.

Filters provide a finer grainted facility for determining which log records to output.

** Logger

Loggers are created by =logging.getLogger= and maintained by the library with its name as the key.
Loggers may be organized into a hierarchy like modules and packages, named like =pacakge.module.submodule=.
