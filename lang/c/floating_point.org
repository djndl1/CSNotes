#+title: Floating Point

The C standard mandates the use of IEEE 754 floating point numbers.

* IEEE 754

IEEE 754-1985 standardized binary floating points of 32-bit single-precision
floating-point numbers, double-precision 64-bit double-precision floating-point
numbers, first implemented by Intel 8087.

The 2008 revision added half-precision (16-bit), quad-precision (128-bit) binary
formats and three decimal floating-point format (32-, 64- and 128-bit)
