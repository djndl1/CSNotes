#+title: X86-32 Assembly Programming

* Registers

32-bit registers are allowed under real-mode with a size prefix.

Aside from extended register size, there are a few control registers:

- =cr0=, =cr1=, =cr2=, =cr3=

* Memory

Segments are still 16-bit but an offset can be up to 4GB.

** Addressing Modes

- Any general-purpose 32-bit register can act as a base or index except =esp=,
  which can only be a base register.

- The index register can have a scaling factor of 1, 2, 4, or 8, specified by
  the multiplication operator =*= and there is no performance penalty.
