* How to Compare

The RISC-V situation: suppose one has =<= (signed and unsigned) and =xor=, we can have the
other five comparison
operations (=<==, ===, =!==, =>=, =>==):

- negation: =xor= the value with all 1s (signed -1, bitwise), or a single 1 bit (logical).

- =>=: swap the operands of =<=, one operation

- =>==: negate the result of =<=, two operations

- =<==: negate the result of =>= (swapped =<=), two operations

- ===, =!==: xor or subtraction on the two operands, they are supposed to be zero if
  they are equal or non-zero unsigned integer if not.
  + =result unsigned< 1= to test equality
  + =0 unsigned< result= to test inequality
