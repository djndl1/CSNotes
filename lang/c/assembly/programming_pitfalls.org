#+title: Programming Pitfalls

* Writing an Incorrect Section Name

=.section data= compiles but the data is not in the =.data= section.
It's *=.data=* not =data=

* Assembly is Limited by Instruction Encoding

In RISC-V you cannot have number of arbitrary length as an immediate number.
In AMD64, =push= cannot push a 64-bit immediate.
