#+title: Programming Pitfalls

* Writing an Incorrect Section Name

=.section data= compiles but the data is not in the =.data= section.
It's *=.data=* not =data=

* Assembly is Limited by Instruction Encoding

In RISC-V you cannot have number of arbitrary length as an immediate number.
In AMD64, =push= cannot push a 64-bit immediate.

* Be Careful of Data Size on Memory

When loading data from memory, be sure that the correct size specifier and
register names are used (especially on x86).

* Remember to Save Callee-Saved Registers in a Function's Prologue

If they are used in the function, save them.
If not, leave them be, assuming any called functions will preserve them as well.
