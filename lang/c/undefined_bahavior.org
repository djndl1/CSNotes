** Serialism

C code provides a mostly serial abstract machine until C11.
Modern instruction-level parallelism (pipeline, speculative prediction, SIMD) offers performance boost without changing
the assumption of the serial abstraction machine.

** Flat Memory

Modern computers have at least three levels of cache in between registers and
main memory to hide latency. Efficient use of the cache is one of the most
important ways of making code run quickly on a modern processor. However C hides
this respect.

** Optimization

There is no simple translation from C to machine code and using C in itself does no imply
performance.

For example, if one interation in a loop is independent from another, the
optimizer can vectorize them. C's syntax provides little information about this.
