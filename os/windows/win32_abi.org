ILP32

- =_Bool=: 1 byte

- =int= and =long= are 4 bytes

- =long long= is 8 bytes

- =long double= is 64-bit floats. No support for x87 80-bit floats since the inception of
  Windows NT and even more not possible since SSE/SSE2/SSE3 was used.

- =wchar_t= 2 bytes, a UTF-16 code unit.

- =NULL= has the value zero.

- =size_t= 32-bit on Win32

- Still no support for other IEEE 754 floating points except binary32 and
  binary64. No support for decimal floating points as of 2025.

For alignment, see [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/alignment-cpp-declarations?view=msvc-170][Alignment]]. By default, the compiler aligns class and struct
members on their size value.
