#+title: Timezone Management

* GNU libc

=/etc/localtime=, a symlink that points a configuration file under =/usr/share/zoneinfo=
(provided typically by =tzdata=) unless overriden by the =TZ= environment
variable or some other application-specific configuration. This symlink is also managed
by  =timedatectl=.

Time zone files are compiled binary (by =zic=) data that contains timezone rules.

Many programs needs a restart before adapting to the new timezone.

On Debian, besides =timedatectl= run =dpkg-reconfigure tzdata= to update the
timezone in the debconf database and the selinux context.

* Debian-Specific =/etc/timezone=

A legacy plan text file containing a time zone name.
=timedatectl= also updates this file on Debian in older versions of =systemd=.

* =TZ=: the POSIX Way

The only-POSIX way of specifying the timezone.

* Java

=/etc/timezone= (Debian), =/etc/sysconfig/clock= (Red Hat).
