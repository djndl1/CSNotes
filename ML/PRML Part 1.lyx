Introduction 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of searching for patterns in data is a fundamental one and has
 a long and successful history.
 The field of pattern recognition is concerned with the automatic discovery
 of regularities in data through the use of computer algorithms and with
 the use of these regularities to take actions such as classifying the data
 into different categories.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of model comparison and model selection arises is an important
 concept.
 To determine a suitable value for the model complexity, we can separate
 a 
\emph on
validation set, 
\emph default
also called a 
\emph on
hold-out
\emph default
 set, used to optimize the model complexity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the over-fitting problem become less severe as the size of the data set
 increases.
 Another way to say this is that the larger the data set, the more complex
 (in other words more flexible) the model that we can afford to fit to the
 data.
 The least squares approach to finding the model parameters represents a
 specific case of maximum likelihood and the overfitting problem can be
 understood as a general property of maximum likelihood.
 By adopting a Bayesian approach, the overfitting problem can be avoided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One technique that is often used to control the overfitting phenomenon is
 that of regularization, which involves adding a penalty term to the error
 function, also known as 
\emph on
shrinkage

 in statistics, 
\emph on
weight decay

 in the context of neural networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Probability Theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Uncertainty is a key concept in the field of pattern recognition.
 It arises both through noise on measurements as well as though the finite
 size of data sets.

\begin_layout Description

theory a consistent framework for the quantification and manipulation of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bayesian probabilities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bayesian methods are characterized by concepts and procedures as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of random variables, or more generally unknown quantities, to model
 all sources of uncertainty in statistical models including uncertainty
 resulting from lack of information (see also aleatoric and epistemic uncertaint
y).
 The need to determine the prior probability distribution taking into account
 the available (prior) information.
 The sequential use of Bayes' formula: when more data become available,
 calculate the posterior distribution using Bayes' formula; subsequently,
 the posterior distribution becomes the next prior.
 While for the frequentist a hypothesis is a proposition (which must be
 either true or false), so that the frequentist probability of a hypothesis
 is either 0 or 1, in Bayesian statistics the probability that can be assigned
 to a hypothesis can also be in a range from 0 to 1 if the truth value is
 uncertain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider an uncertain event.
 Our assessment of the problem will affect the actions we take.
 We quantify our expression of uncertainty and make precise revisions of
 uncertainty in light of new evidence as well as subsequently to be able
 to take optimal actions or decisions as a consequence.
 One advantage of the Bayesian viewpoint is that the inclusion of prior
 knowledge arises naturally.
 There is no unique frequentist and Bayesian viewpoint.
 One common critism of the Bayesian approach is that the prior distribution
 is often selected on the basis of mathematical convenience rather than
 as a reflection of any prior beliefs.
 Bayesian methods based on poor choices of prior can give poor results with
 high confidence.
 The dramatic improvements in the speed and memory capacity of computers,
 opened the door to the practical use of Bayesian techniques in an impressive
 range of problem domains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example*
Reconsider the curve fitting problem.
 Assume the corresponding value of 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 has a Gaussian distribution 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(t|x,\mathbf{w},\beta\right)=\mathcal{N}\left(t|y\left(x,\mathbf{w}\right),\beta^{-1}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $y\left(x,\mathbf{w}\right)$
\end_inset

 is the polynomial curve.
 MAL with a training data set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{x},\mathbf{t}\right\} $
\end_inset

, we gain the same result as the minimal square method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example*
A more Bayesian approach would involve a prior distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(\mathbf{w}|\alpha\right)=\mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{w}|0,\alpha^{-1}I\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is a 
\emph on
hyperparameter 
\emph default
which controls the parameter of the model,
\emph on
 
\emph default
then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(\mathbf{w}|\mathbf{x},\mathbf{t},\alpha,\beta\right)\propto p\left(\mathbf{t}|\mathbf{x},\mathbf{w},\beta\right)p\left(\mathbf{w}|\alpha\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Example*
By maximizing the posterior distribution (MAP), we obtain the regularized
 sum-of-squares error function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example*
A full Bayesian treatment would be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(t|x,\mathbf{x},\mathbf{t}\right)=\int p\left(t|x,\mathbf{w}\right)p\left(\mathbf{w}|\mathbf{x},\mathbf{t}\right)d\mathbf{w}
\]

\end_inset

By making the two distributions Gaussian, the left side 11222predictive
 distribution can be analytically determined.
 The resulting distribution is dependent on the sample to predictive 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Model Selection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
To determine the parameters of the model so that the best predictive performance
 can be achieved
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If data is plentiful, then one approach is simply to use some of the available
 data to train a range of models, or a given model with a range of values
 for its complexity parameters, and then to compare them on independent
 data, sometimes called a 
\emph on
validation set
\emph default
, and select the one having the best predictive performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the model design is iterated many times using a limited size data set,
 then some over fitting to the validation data can occur and so it may be
 necessary to keep aside a third 
\emph on
test set
\emph default
 on which the performance of the selected model is finally evaluated.

\begin_layout Section
The Curse of Dimensionality 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Think about what a general 
\begin_inset Formula $M$

\begin_inset Formula $D$

\begin_inset Formula $D^{M}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of the volume of the surface between 
\begin_inset Formula $r=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r=1-\epsilon$
\end_inset

 shows that our geometrical intuitions formed in a space of three dimensions,
 can fail badly in a space of higher dimensionality.
 In spaces of high dimensionality, most of the volume of a sphere is concentrate
d in a thin shell near the surface.
 In a high-dimensional space, most the probability mass of a Gaussian is

\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The minimum probability of making a mistake is obtained if each value of

Consider a regression problem.
 We intend to minimize the average or expected loss

\[
E\left[L\right]=\int\int L\left(t,y\left(x\right)\right)p\left(\mathbf{x},t\right)d\mathbf{x}dt.

Suppose the loss function is 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(t,y\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\right)=\left\{ y\left(\mathbf{x}\right)-t\right\} ^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The original average loss can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E\left[L\right]=\int\left\{ y\left(\mathbf{x}\right)-E\left[t|\mathbf{x}\right]\right\} ^{2}p\left(\mathbf{x}\right)d\mathbf{x}+\int\left\{ E\left[t|\mathbf{x}\right]-t\right\} ^{2}p\left(\mathbf{x}\right)d\mathbf{x}.

 A more powerful approach models the conditional probability

\end_inset

 in an inference stage and then uses this distribution to make optimal decisions.
 One way to the model is to model directly, the other is to adopt a generative
 approach, i.e., to model the class-conditional densities

 and the prior probabilities

MAL can exhibit severe overfitting for data sets that are linearly separable.
 When

 from each class 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is assigned a posterior probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(C_{k}|x\right)=1$

 There is a continuum of such solutions because any separating hyperplane
 will give rise to the same posterior probabilities at the training data
 points, in which case MAL provides no way to favor one over another, depending
 on the choice of optimization algorithm and the parameter initialization.The
 singularity can be avoided by inclusion of a prior and finding a MAP solution
 for

 Combining Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is often found that improved performance can be obtained by combining
 multiple models together in some way, instead of just using a single model
 in isolation.
 Training 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 different models and then making predictions using the average of the predictio
ns made by each model is an example.
 Such combinations of models are called 
\emph on
committees
\emph default
.
 One important variant of the committee method is 
\emph on
boosting, 
\emph default
involving training multiple models in sequence in which the error function
 used to train a particular model depends on the performance of the previous
 models.
 An alternative form of model combination is to select one of the models
 to make the prediction, and different models become responsible for making
 predictions in different regions of input space.
 One widely used framework of this kind is known as 
\emph on
decision tree
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
14.4 Tree-based Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are various simple, but widely used, models that work by partitioning
 the input space into cuboid regions, whose edges are aligned with the axes,
 and then assigning a simple model to each region.
 They can be viewed as a model combination method in which only one model
 is responsible for making predictions at any given point in input space.
 The process of selecting a specific model, given a new input x, can be
 described by a sequential decision making process corresponding to the
 traversal of a binary tree.

Here a particular tree-based framework 
\emph on

\emph default

 tree must be determined, including which input variable is chosen at each
 node to form the split criterion as well as the value of the threshold
 parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{i}$
\end_inset

 for the split and, of course, the predictive variable within each region.
