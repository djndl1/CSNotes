#+title: Intel Pentium Era Before Core

* The Original Pentium (P5, March 1993)

800nm, 600nm, 350nm

- The first superscalar (multiple-issue) x86 processor.
  + Two pipelines of 5 stages
  + there are multiple execution units within one CPU core.
  + instructions are issued from a sequential instruction stream;
    the CPu dynamically checks for data dependencies between instructions at
    run time; the CPU can execute multiple instructions per clock cycle.
  + essentially all general-purpose CPU developed since 1998 are superscalar
    except some embedded processors.
  + superscalar processors are limited by the intrinsic sequentialism of the
    program logic (program logic, branch processing, dependency checking).

- Optimized microcode system and RISC-like techniques.

- Redesigned fast FPU

- 64-bit data bus, internal and external.

- separate code and data caches.

- branch prediction

- Multiprocessing support

** Pentium MMX

350 nm - 250 nm

- MMX SIMD: 57 instructions that handle packed integer arithmetic (64-bit data with overflow saturate semantics).
  + the 8 MM0-MM7 registers are aliases for the matissa part of x87 FPU 80-bit
    registers. The disadvantage of MMX is that it cannot deal with floating
    point, and thus requires the x87 instructions to step in and take over the registers.
  + Software support is limited and as of 2000 still typically written in assembly.
  + AMD addes 3DNow! as an extension to MMX, which adds 32-bit floating-point support.

- 6-stage pipeline

* Pentium Pro (the P6 Microarchitecture or i686, 1995)

The sixth generation x86 microprocessor by Intel, knonwn for its low power
consumption, excellent integer performance and relatively high IPC. The ancestor of modern Intel
Core microarchitecture.

- conditional move instructions =CMOVcc= and =FCMOVcc=, conditional jump =Jcc=.
  + conditional statement with a costly conditional branch.

- =UD2= illegal instruction for developers to crash the program.

- RISC implementation with a x86 decoding front end.

- 14-stage superpipelined

- out-of-order execution including speculative execution via register renaming.

- 36-bit address bus but with PAE

- first x86 processor to support upgradeable microcode under BIOS or OS control.

- There is no MMX support

Frequent pipeline flushing when dealing with mixed code (8-bit with 16-bit,
16-bit with 32-bit), and thus not suitable for PC users, but used with 32-bit OS
(NT, Unix).

* Pentium II (May 1997, 233Mhz to 450MHz, 350-180 nm)

A more consumer-oriented version of Pentium Pro, combining the P6 microarchitecture with MMX, largely a Pentium Pro.

- MMX support

- Improved 16-bit code execution performance by adding segment register caches.

- In-Package 512KB L2 cache

** Revisions

- Klamath: 233, 266, 300 MHz at 66 Mhz FSB.

- Deschutes: 333, 266, 300 (66MT/s FSB); 350, 400, 450 (100 MT/s)
  + combined with the 440BX chipset and its derivatives.
  + =FXSAVE=, =FXRSTOR= instructions

- Tonga and Dixon, 250 and 180 nm mobile versions.

** Covington & Mendocino Celeron

- Covington (Apr. 1998): Pentium II without L2 cache with poor performance

- Mendocino (August 1998): 128KB full-speed L2 cache with great performance, from 300MHz up to 533MHz

* Pentium III (Feb. 1999 until early 2003)

Continued evolution from P6

- SSE SIMD to accelerate floating-point and parallel calculations

** Revisions

- Katmai: further development of Deschutes Pentium II.
  + 250nm process
  + 450, 500, 550, 533B (133MHz FSB), 600B (133MHz FSB)

- Coppermine (Oct. 1999):
  + On-chip L2 cache
  + 180nm process
  + 500MHz up to 1GHz

- Tualatin: (2001)
  + 130nm process
  + 1.0, 1.13, 1.2, 1.26, 1.33 and 1.4GHz
  + the basis for Pentium-III M and later Pentium-M

** Coppermine-128 Celeron

Derivative of Coppermine Pentium-III with 128KB on-chip L2 cache. 566MHz up to 1100MHz.

** Tualatin-256 Celeron (Oct. 2001)

- 100MHz bus, 256KB L2 cache.

- 130nm process

- 1.0 up to 1.4GHz, with comparable performance with Pentium 4 Willamette.
