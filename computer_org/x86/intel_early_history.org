#+title: Intel Early History

This note covers the history of Intel CPU before modern Core microarchitectures
since 8086.


* Before x86

- *4004*: as the first significant example of LSI with MOS gates, mainly used for calculators
  + 4-bit bus
  + highly integrated, requires fewer external components, mostly as embedded controllers.

- *8008* (1972): more flexible but requires more external circuits.
  + 8-bit data bus, 14-bit address bus (16K memory)
  + partially implemented interrupt mechanism
  + the CPU for the very first commercial non-calculator PCs.

- *8080* (1974): 8008 with registers expanded
  + 16-bit address but

- *8085* (1976): a version implemented with depletion-mode transistors

** Similar Processors From Other Vendors

- *Zilog Z80*:
  + designed by none other than Fedrico Faggin, one of the designer of Intel 8080.
  + software compatible with Intel 8080 with increased performance.
  + wide spread in video game systems and home computers in the '70s and the
    early '80s.

* 8086

A non-strict extension of 8080.
