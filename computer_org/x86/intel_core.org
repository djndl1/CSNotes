* The Core Microarchitecture (June 2006)

The Core μarch intended to deliver an energy-efficient solution, not simply
increasing clock rate. The performance is related to the frequency and the IPC,
which is determined by many factors such as the microarchitecture, instruction
capacbility (SIMD). Power consumption is related to the /dynamic capacitance/,
voltage and frequency:

$$
Power = Dynamic Capacitance \times Voltage^{2} \times Frequency
$$

Designers carefully balance IPC efficiency and dynamic capacitance with the
required voltage and frequency to optimize for performance and power efficiency.

They are branded as Core 2, Pentium Dual-Core, Celeron M, Xeon.

** Major Features

- native x86-64 support

- 14-stage pipeline, less than half of Prescott's

- 533 MT/s to 1600 MT/s FSB

- 65nm to 45 nm

- MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4

- No VT-x generally

*** Wide Dynamic Execution (Further Enhanced Out-Of-Order Execution)

More accurate branch prediction, deeper instruction buffers, enhanced ALU,
enhanced micro-op fusion (first appeared in Pentium M) and the new /Macrofusion/
techinique. Potentially 4 instructions per core at a time

- Macrofusion (new, macro-instruction, i.e. an ISA instruction, as compared to
  micro-instruction within a CPU): two x86 instructions may be combined into a single micro-operation.

*** Intelligent Power Capability

Power gating capability with an fine-grained logic control

- turns on individual processor logic systems only if needed

*** Advanced Smart Cache

Multi-core optimized cache.

- Shared L2 cache for dual cores

*** Smart Memory Access

- /memory disambiguation/: typical out-of-order processors do not reschedule
  loads ahead of stores to avoid data dependency violation. Memory
  disambiguation tries to speculate if a load may precede a store.

- /advanced prefetchers/ (prefetching memory contents into cache): two prefetchers per L1 cache and two per L2 cache.
  Prefetchers detect multiple streaming and strided access patterns.

*** Advanced Digital Media Boost

The Core μarch runs these instructions one per cycle compared to one every two
cycle in previous generations.
