                  designed to outperform all other x86 CPUs by a signifi- cant
                  margin. Although it shares some design techniques with
                  competitors such as AMD’s K5, NexGen’s Nx586, and Cyrix’s M1,
                  the new Intel chip has several important advantages over these
