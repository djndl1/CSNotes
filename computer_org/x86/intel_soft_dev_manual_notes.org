* Conventions & Concepts

- Reserved bits are not only undefined by *unpredictable*. Never depend on their
  states, never use them to store information, on purpose or accidentally, mask
  them before testing the register.

- *exception*: there is the concept of exception for CPUs, an event that
  typically occurs when an instruction causes an error or other conditions.
