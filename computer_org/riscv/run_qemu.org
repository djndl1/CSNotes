#+title: Run_qemu

- /System Emulation/: a virtual model of an entire machine. The CPU is either fully emulated or a real CPU managed by a hypervisor.

- /Use Mode Emulation/: launch process compiled for one CPU on another.

- /Virtualization/: execute the guest code directly on the host CPU.

* System Emulation

=qemu-system-=

** Device Emulation

- /Device frontend/: the virtual device the guest sees, =--device=

- /device buses/: most devices exist on a bus of some sort. in some cases, the bus a device is attached to should be specified along with its address.

- /device backend/: how the data from the emulated device will be processed by QEMU. =--chardev=, =--netdev=, =--blockdev=

- /device passthrough/: the device is actually given access to the underlying hardware.

* Networks

The guest part has the virtual network device and the host has backends that interacts with the emulated NIC.

** Backends

configured using =-netdev TYPE,id=NAME,...=

Every virtual network devices needs its own backend. The =id= is used to distinguish backends.

There are several different backends.

*** User Networking (SLIRP)

default and requires no root/administrator privileges.

- poor performance.

- ICMP generally does not work.

- not directly accssible from the host or the external network.
